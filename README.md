# Fun-Bat-Viruses
Just some fun virues to mess with your friends
-----------------------------------------

TurnOff.bat
-----------------------------------------
When it is finished it will pin itself to start and shutdown the pc, it will shutdown the pc every time it boots. The way around it? Simply boot in safe mode

notepad.bat
-----------------------------------------
Starts so many notepads that the pc can't seem to run

makeItWorse.bat
-----------------------------------------
Okay so this is probably the most stable of the MD bombers here. Run it and it will fill your entire desktop with empty file folders, this makes it super hard to run anything and the whole computer pretty much just crashes. You can't open files and it is even hard to delete them. 

minecraftLauncher.bat/notAVirus.bat
-----------------------------------------
The notAVirus1-3 files and the "Minecraft Launcher" need some setup but they do the same thing as MakeItWorse.bat. Set the icon of "Minecraft Launcher" to the minecraft launcher icon then hide the other three files. Simply put it on someones desktop and when they try to open minecraft it will run 3 MD bombers, constantly opening them. I don't find it to really be as effective as MakeItWorse but it will work and it has a fun delivery method
